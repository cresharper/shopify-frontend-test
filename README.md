## Shopify Front End Engineer Test

Below you will find an excercise that will test your knowledge of the Shopify Platform.

We have sent you a development store to use. Import some products, (use the Dummy Products resource below,) and create a Collection called "Featured Products."  Once created add 20 Products to it.

Using the Debut theme, engineer a new section that will act as a carousel/slider of products using the Swiper library (resource below). Display 4 products at full width, and as you press the arrow it should scroll to the next set of 4.  The options for this Swiper should be customizable in the Editor on Shopify.

The design of how this should look is completely open to you.

### Some Rules

- You can only use Vanilla Javascript. jQuery, although very much a part of the Shopify paradigm, is a thing of the past.
- The slider should be responsive.
- Think reuseable.

### Deliverables

Once you are finished, fork this repo.  Then download the code from Shopify, and commit it to master on your newly forked repo.

Email jeff [at] themazegroup [dot] com, the URL for the repo, and feel free to explain the approach you took.

I should be able to go into the Home page of the Editor, add your module to the home page, and customize it.
